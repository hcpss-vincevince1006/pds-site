<p class="post__paragraph--callout">A Professional Development Schools (PDS) program is a collaboratively planned and implemented partnership for the academic and clinical preparation of teacher candidates and the continuous professional development of both school system and higher education faculty.</p>

<h2>What are Professional Development Schools?</h2>
  <p><strong>PDS schools place student interns in their classrooms.</strong> Student interns are typically from a teacher education program at a partnering local Maryland College or University. A PDS placement enhances an intern's real-world experience, while providing the PDS school with a high-quality intern to help promote student achievement.</p>

<h2>PDSP Mission</h2>
